**Functionality of this app
1. I have created this app with the help of open API.
2. I have used 2 api's here
   1. To show the random image for given location(NewYork, UnitedStates)
   2. Next is for showing weather condition.
3. This app has Live button.
4. In first page we can enter the location we want, then based on the location image will be shown in the background, there is Live button. Once you click live button it will move to the next page then the complete weather report will be shown as we entered the location.
5. There is dropdown. There we can find 2 reports, one is for last month, next one is for current day.
